What is an Exception?
In this section you will learn about what an exception is and see examples of them.

Definition
An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of code. This error causes the code to raise an exception and if not prepared to handle it will halt the execution of the code.

Exception Handling
In this section you will learn how to handle exceptions. You will understand how to make your program perform specified tasks instead of halting code execution when an exception is encountered.

Try Except
A try except will allow you to execute code that might raise an exception and in the case of any exception or a specific one we can handle or catch the exception and execute specific code. This will allow us to continue the execution of our program even if there is an exception.

Python tries to execute the code in the try block. In this case if there is any exception raised by the code in the try block, it will be caught and the code block in the except block will be executed. After that, the code that comes after the try except will be executed.
